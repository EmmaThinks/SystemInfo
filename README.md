# INFO MANAGER

this is my first Rust project just made to learn.

## Short Description: 
It tends to be a resource manager for my next pc upgrade, display this in a separate screen from my principal monitors so i can see what's happening without changing my apps.

## Can do: 
- Show virtual & physical ram usage.
- Show CPU usage by core.
- Show CPU brand name
- Linux / windows compatible
